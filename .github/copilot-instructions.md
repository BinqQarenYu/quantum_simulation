# Project Overview
This repository visually simulates quantum particles to help humans understand how they work, from fundamental interactions and fields to their mathematical dimensions. The goal is to provide an educational and intuitive visualization of quantum phenomena.

# Tech Stack
- Python (primary language for simulation and computation)
- Visualization libraries for rendering quantum particle behavior
- Mathematical computation libraries for quantum mechanics calculations

# Coding Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use descriptive variable names that reflect quantum physics terminology
- Document complex quantum mechanics formulas with clear comments
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes explaining the physics concepts
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Keep simulation code modular and testable

# Directory Structure
- `/` - Root directory contains project documentation
- Code for quantum simulation and visualization will be organized by functionality

# Reference Resources
- README.md contains the project description and goals
- Focus on educational clarity when implementing quantum physics concepts
- Prioritize accuracy in quantum mechanics calculations while maintaining code readability
