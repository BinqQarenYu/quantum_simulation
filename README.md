# Quantum Simulation

## Overview
A VS Code project for visually simulating quantum particles, fields, and fundamental interactions in an interactive 3D world—paired with panels for data, formula manipulation, and app settings. The goal is to make quantum behavior graspable through spatial intuition, dynamic visuals, and live math.

## Features
- **3D World UI**: Place particles, fields, and interactions on a simulated field.
- **Data Panel**: View state vectors, observables, spectra, and time series.
- **Formula Lab**: Edit model equations, parameters, and boundary conditions.
- **Settings Panel**: Configure rendering, precision, integrators, and device backends.
- **Simulation Playback**: Zoom from classical scales down to quantum and Planck scales, observing phenomena like tunneling and entanglement.
